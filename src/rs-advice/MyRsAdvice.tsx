            importantly, be kind to yourself. You are so much more than the girls who ghosted you and rejected you. 
            Take it easy on yourself, don't beat yourself up if things don't end up the way you want them to be. Don't 
            do things that go against your values, be patient and know that the right one will show up one day!"
